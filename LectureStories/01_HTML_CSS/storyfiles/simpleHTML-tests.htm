HTML Tests</h1>

<p><a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html" target="_blank">Tire Sizing by 
Sheldon Brown</a> appears on the site sheldonbrown.com.  I have used the content of this article for some experiments with simple HTML.  You can bring up this article in your browser and also view its source.  
</p>

<p>
In this version on <a href="../HTMLtests/tire-sizing-01.htm" target="_blank">tire-sizing-01</a>, I have used mostly simple HTML tags, e.g. <code>&lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;</code>, with no formatting attributes.   Everything is flush left and the tables, except for the first, have no borders.
</p>

<p>
In this version of <a href="../HTMLtests/tire-sizing-02.htm" target="_blank">tire-sizing-02</a>, I have added inline styles attributes to many of the tags.  I also put in anchor tags and made the navigation elements at the top of the article work. Some of the changes you should see are:
<ul>
<li>
Some of the headings and text are centered.
</li>
<li>
Some images are centered and others float to the right of the text.
</li>
<li>
The tables are centered and have borders.
</li>
<li>
The title font color is red.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The source for files "tire-sizing-01.htm" and "tire-sizing-02.htm" appear on the next two slides.
