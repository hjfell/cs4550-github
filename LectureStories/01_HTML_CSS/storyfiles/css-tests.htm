<p>
In this version of the Tire Sizing article, <a href="../CSStests/tire-sizing-03.htm" target="_blank">tire-sizing-03</a>, I have moved the inline style attributes to a style declaration in the document head. Here are some of the changes that you should see in the body of the document, 
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;</code> has been changed to  <code>&lt;p class="center"&gt;</code>
<br />Similar changes appear in <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags.
</li>
<li>The title style is now set with <code>id=articletitle</code> </li>
<li>The author style is now set with <code>id=byline</code> </li>
<li>All the tables have style set with <code>class="grid"</code></li>
<li>The cumbersome style atributes that were in the navigation list and its elements are covered by <code>&lt;ul class="hlist"&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In <a href="../CSStests/tire-sizing-04.htm" target="_blank">tire-sizing-04</a>,  the styles have been moved to a css file, <a href="../CSStests/bike-article-style.css" target="_blank">bike-article-style.css</a>
</p>

<p>This file, <a href="../CSStests/RR-style-css-tests.htm" target="_blank">RR-style-css-tests.htm</a>, shows some experiments with the main style sheet <a href="../CSStests/style.css" target="_blank">style.css</a> that Professor Rasala provided for his site.

<p>
The source for files "tire-sizing-03.htm," "tire-sizing-04.htm" and "RR-style-css-tests.htm" appear on the next three slides.
