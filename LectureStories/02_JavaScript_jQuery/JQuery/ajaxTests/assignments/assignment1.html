	Assignment 1 - Due Friday, January 10, 2014 by 9 PM
</h2>
<h3>Getting Setup</h3> 
<ul>
	<li>Set up <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html" target="_blank">MAMP</a>, <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" target="_blank">XAMPP</a>, or some other Apache, MySQL, PHP server on your own machine.</li>
	<li>Get a domain name and an account with a private hosting company of your choice. I am using <a href="http://www.ipage.com/join/index.bml?AffID=708727" target="_blank">iPage</a> for this course. <span style="color:blue;">Disclosure: I may be compensated if you sign up via this iPage link. If that happens, I will donate the profits to a charity chosen by the class.</span> You should make sure to get hosting for at least the length of this course (4 months). This should cost under $50. You may not use your own dorm room server that is only up for a few hours a day. The TA and I must be able to access you site at our convenience. </li>
	<li>Set up an (S)FTP server so you can upload pages.</li>
	<li>Get an editor for writing your HTML and other files. Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac) will do but you will probably want an editor that does syntax highlighting and possibly checking. I use bbEdit on my MAC and textastic.app on my iPad but there are free alternatives, e.g. 
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.coffeecup.com/free-editor/" target="_blank">CoffeeCup</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit" target="_blank">Komodo Edit</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://panic.com/coda/" target="_blank">Coda 2</a> does (S)FTP and has a code editor and a mySQL editor</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li> Find the directory where the Web server begins looking for files. Put a file there named "index.html" and fill it with text identifying this as your server. I suggest that you don't put your email address on the page for now to avoid spam. 
	<p>
		Connect to your server from a Web browser, using only the host name, "yoursite.com". (For the class site, this is cs4550.com but my index page is a forwarding page that takes you to a subdirectory so you actually end up at http://cs4550.com/cs4550/index.html.) 
	</p>
	<p>
		Verify that http://yoursite.com shows your index page. 
	</p>
	</li>
	<li> Use an HTML validator, e.g. http://validator.w3.org/, to make sure that your HTML is legal. </li>
	<li> Set up a blog on a site of your choosing, e.g. wordpress.com, blogger.com, tumblr.com (or install wordpress on your own site but that is really not necessary). Write in your blog about your experiences in getting started. </li>
	<li> Send me the urls so I can find your site and your blog.<br />
	<strong>NOTE:</strong> These will be public so that the whole class can view them. </li>
	<li>Your index.html will be your home page for the course. At a minimum, it should have: 
	<ul>
		<li>your name, 
		<li> 
		<li>your picture, 
		<li> 
		<li>links to your work for this course - start with a link to your blog. 
		<li> 
	</ul>
	<li>You can keep this page simple for now and improve it as the term goes on.</li>
</ul>
