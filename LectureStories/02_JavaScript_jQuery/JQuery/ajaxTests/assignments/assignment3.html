<h3>
	JavaScript, jQuery, Dynamics and Interaction
</h3>
<ul>
	<li> Reading:<br />
	Read and try out some of the things in these w3schools Tutorials. You have all programmed in other languages and the Javascript structures and functions should be familiar ideas. Do read the section on the HTML DOM. jQuery is a JavaScript library that we use when we manipulate the HTML DOM (Document Object Model). 
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank">w3schools JavaScript</a> </li>
		<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp" target="_blank">w3schools jQuery</a> </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This week, you will use some JavaScript and jQuery to add movement and client-side interaction to your reservation system. Be imaginative. There are many ways to do these things. 
	<ul>
		<li> Add a slideshow to your site to show off your products - rooms, bikes, or whatever your clients are reserving. </li>
		<li> Add a calculator of some sort, e.g. so the client can find out what the total rental will cost. </li>
		<li> Add a "credits" page if you do not already have one. Make sure to cite any resources you have used to build your site.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li> I have added two slide shows in this version of my <a href="../starshipPinafore-02/" target="_blank">Starship Pinafore Event Booking</a> site. See the Rooms and Locations pages. I have also added checkboxes for food and radio buttons for drink on the "Services" page and a calculator that tells the cost of the selected menu. Finally, I have added a "Credits" page with links to the image sources and to code and tutorials sources. Since that is really not part of the reservation system, I have put the Credits link at the bottom of the page. </li>
</ul>
