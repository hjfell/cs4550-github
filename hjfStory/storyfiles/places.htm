<h1 class="center">Places I have lived</h1>
<p class="left">
I was born in Brooklyn New York and live in the <a href="http://www.tapeshare.com">East New York</a> section of Brooklyn until shortly before my 12th birthday.
</p>
<p>
We then moved to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens">Queens, New York</a> where I lived until I graduated from high school.
</p>
<p>
I spent the next three summers in Washington D.C.
