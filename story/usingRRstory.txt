Some tips:
	unpack Rasala's story.zip at you web root
	do not alter anything inside this folder or add anything to the folder.
	you must be online to use the utility as it loads jQuery from the web.

In the folder where your source code lives
	create a text file story.text
	start with just simple contents like this in your story,txt file
		somefileinyourfolder.html my file
		story.txt the story file

in your browser, go to
	yourWebRootDirectory/story/index.htm?<path to your folder from the story directory>
for example
	http://localhost:8888/story/index.htm?../yourfolder

This should bring up a two-page story.  If it works, try adding this line to your story.txt that uses showfile.htm.
e.g
	<path from the folder that has story.txt to the story folder>/showfile.htm?<path from the story folder back to the folder that has story.txt>/somefileinyourfolder.html my file source
	
Reload your browser and see if your story now has 3 pages, one with the source text of somefileinyourfolder.html.
