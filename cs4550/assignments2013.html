			<div>
				<ul>
					<li>Set up <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html" target="_blank">MAMP</a>, <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" target="_blank">XAMPP</a>, or some other Apache, MySQL, PHP server on your own machine.</li>
					<li>Get an <a href="http://www.ipage.com/join/index.bml?AffID=708727" target="_blank">iPage account and domain name.</a> You should make sure to get hosting for at least the length of this course (4 months). There are often sales but just in case there is not a good sale going, my account manager at iPage is 
					<script>linkemail('ipage-inc.com','kylek','Kyle King');</script>
					. If you are registered for this course, you may contact him to sign up for hosting. He has promised a price of $42 for 12 months including a domain name for the year. </li>
					<li>Set up an (S)FTP server so you can upload pages.</li>
					<li>Get an editor for writing your HTML and other files. Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac) will do but you will probably want an editor that does syntax highlighting and possibly checking. I use bbEdit on my MAC and textastic.app on my iPad but there are free alternatives 
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.coffeecup.com/free-editor/" target="_blank">CoffeeCup</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit" target="_blank">Komodo Edit</a></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li> Find the directory where the Web server begins looking for files. Put a file there named "index.html" and fill it with text identifying this as your server. I suggest that you don't put your email address on the page for now to avoid spam. 
					<p>
						Connect to your server from a Web browser, using only the host name, "yoursite.com". (For the class site, this is cs4550.com but my index page is a forwarding page that takes you to a subdirectory so you actually end up at http://cs4550.com/cs4550/index.html.) 
					</p>
					<p>
						Verify that http://yoursite.com shows your index page. 
					</p>
					</li>
					<li> Use an HTML validator, e.g. http://validator.w3.org/, to make sure that your HTML is legal. </li>
					<li> Set up a blog on a site of your choosing, e.g. wordpress.com, blogger.com, tumblr.com (or install wordpress on your own site but that is really not necessary). Write about your experiences in getting started. </li>
					<li> Send me the information so I can find your site and your blog.<br />
					<strong>NOTE:</strong> These will be public so that the whole class can view them. </li>

					Get started reading the material on these first two sites. Some of you may know all of this, for others, the material may be new. We will discuss some of these constructs in class and learn more as we need to. The third page is a brief article on designing websites.

					</li>
					<li> Decide on the reservation/rental system that you would like to build.<br />
					Plan the site for your system by filling in this template in your blog. 
					<ul>
						<li> <strong>Background</strong><br />
						[Describe the background of your client and the main needs of the website; a couple of sentences is enough] </li>
						<li> <strong>Requirements</strong> 
						<ul>
							<li> <strong>Users</strong><br />
							[describe the users who will visit the website; what kinds of questions did you ask to come up with the users? Be sure to list those questions to show the client how to arrived at your list of users]</li>
							<li> <strong>Use Cases</strong><br />
							[what will the users want to do on the site? How did you come up with those uses? Be sure to express your use cases in the format “[verb] [ action ] [ outcome ]”, e.g., “book an event room”; be sure to list different scenarios that must be considered when designing the website, for example, three-hour events, week-long events, specific locations, catering, etc.]</li>
							<li> <strong>Functional Requirements</strong><br />
							[what specific needs do users have?]</li>
							<li> <strong>Non-Functional Requirements</strong><br />
							[are there other considerations that are not listed above, e.g., mobile access, booking via smart phones?]</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li> <strong>Design Specification</strong> 
						<ul>
							<li> <strong>Content Needs</strong><br />
							[list the type of information that you will need to have on the website]</li>
							<li> <strong>Media Needs</strong><br />
							[what kinds of media will you host on the site and why? Video? Images? Forms? Calendars? Blogs?]</li>
							<li> <strong>External Links</strong><br />
							[what external websites will you link to? why]</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li> <strong>Page Flow</strong><br />

			<div>
				<ul>
					<li> Reading:<br />
					Read and try out some of the things in these w3schools Tutorials. You have all programmed in other languages and the Javascript structures and functions should be familiar ideas. Do read the section on the HTML DOM. jQuery is a JavaScript library that we use when we manipulate the HTML DOM (Document Object Model). 
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank">w3schools JavaScript</a> </li>
						<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp" target="_blank">w3schools jQuery</a> </li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>This week, you will use some JavaScript and jQuery to add movement and client-side interaction to your reservation system. Be imaginative. There are many ways to do these things. 
					<ul>
						<li> Add a slideshow to your side to show off your products - rooms, bikes, or whatever your clients are reserving. </li>
						<li> Add a calculator of some sort, e.g. so the client can find out what the total rental will cost. </li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li> I have added two slide shows in this version of my <a href="../starshipPinafore-02" target="_blank">Starship Pinafore Event Booking</a> site. See the Rooms and Locations pages. I have also added checkboxes for food and radio buttons for drink on the "Services" page and a calculator that tells the cost of the selected menu. Finally, I have added a "Credits" page with links to the image sources and to code and tutorials sources. Since that is really not part of the reservation system, I have put the Credits link at the bottom of the page. </li>

				<li>Create a reservation form for your system. Use JavaScript, jQuery, and/or PHP for validation.</li>
				<li>Show that you have actually collected the user's entered values with some kind of feedback, e.g. an alert box or an addition to the page.
				<li>We will be starting on MySQL in class this week so I do not expect that most of you will be storing the input information yet.  You can change your form later but creating it now should help you think about what tables and columns you will have to create in your database.

		<li>Use your blog to submit a proposal for your term project.<br />
		For partners, one posting is enough. The other person should just post a pointer to their partner's blog.</li>
		<li>Your proposal should include answers to the questions your were asked to write about for your reservation site.</li>
		<li>Your term project should be a major work that should be at least as impressive as the reservation systems.</li>
		<li>You may work in pairs or alone. We expect that 2-person projects reflect the efforts of two people and do more than solo projects. Let us know what each partner will be doing.</li>
		<li>Grades will be given on the basis of look and feel, usability, quality of code, and general creativity.</li>
		<li>Some general guidelines: 
		<ul>
			<li>Make good use of style sheets and php includes to get a unified feel across your pages.<br />
			There should be several pages. How many depends on the nature of your site.</li>
			<li>There must be database interaction.</li>
			<li>Forms should have validation. </li>
			<li>You should use some API, e.g. google maps, rss feed, ...</li>
			<li>For data-driven sites, use real data should be real, e.g. from Rotten Tomatoes or Amazon.</li>
			<li>Include social media buttons.</li>
			<li>Add some extras, e.g. a shopping cart, captchas, file uploads (of safe things like jpgs), cookies and/or local storage, session tracking ...</li>
			<li>If some of these items do not apply to your site, let us know why they don't fit.</li>
