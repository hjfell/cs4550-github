<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Students in this class should learn enough HTML, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, XML, JSON, PHP, and SQL and other tools, as needed, to create dynamic web sites that include client-side and server-side scripting.
</li>
<li>
Students will hone their writing skills as they blog their goals, plans, design decisions, accomplishments, and user guidelines.
</li>
<li>
Students will hone their presentation skills as give technical presentations on their own work and on other web topics and tools.
</li>
<li>
Finally, Students will finish this course with their own web site that should be something the can show off to future employers or graduate school admission committees as well as family and friends.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expectations of Students</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Students are expected to share their knowledge and help each other develop skills.  
</li>
<li>
It is very easy to find things on the web to use in your projects and to some extent, this often is acceptable but you must always give credit to the source.  This also applies to any materials you get from your classmates.  Never use copyrighted material without permission of the owner.
</li>
<li>
You will be creating your own pages for the initial assignments.  Make them your own.
</li>
<li>
You may work alone or in pairs for the final assignments.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Books and Supplies</h3>
<ul>
<li>I assume that you have your own machine.
</li>
<li>The main expense for this course will be $42 to set up your site.
</li>
<li>You may want a good editor for HTML, JavaScript, and PHP.  I use BBEdit on my MAC but the choice is yours and there are free editors available.
</li>
<li>There is a wealth of instructional material on the web. See the "Instructional Materials" page.  There are also many good book out there that are not very expensive, especially in electronic formats.  I will add some of these to the Instructional materials page but you do not have to purchase them.
<p>
 <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/rasala/webstories.htm">Professor Rasala's Web Development Stories</a> probably has links to anything you might want.
</p>
