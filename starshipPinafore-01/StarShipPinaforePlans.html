<h1>Starship Pinafore Design</h1>
<ul>
	<li>	
	<ul>
		<li> <strong>Background</strong><br />
		The Starship Pinafore was launched on stardate 475023.  It is privately owned and independent of the United Federation of Planets Starfleet.  We can and will go anywhere in the universe, for a price.  We will do our best to be in convenient locations for clients who rent one of our smaller spaces while clients who rent our large bar and party space will have a choice of destination.  We offer a large variety of food and drink to suit many species.</li>
		<li> <strong>Requirements</strong> 
		<ul>
			<li> <strong>Users</strong><br />
			<b>Backend Users</b><br />
			There is a team of backend users who are directed by Lieutenant Fell.  These users will need access to reservation information in time to prepare the rooms for the booked events.  These include:
			<ul>
				<li>Cooks who will primarily use replicators to generate their fare but will sometimes requisitions natural specialties from their native location.</li>
				<li>Treasurer and Goon Squad who see to it that bills are paid in a timely fashion.</li>
				<li>Engineers who will be in charge of light, sound, and holodeck shows.  They will also be responsible for preparing the life support systems and transporters to suit visiting species.</li>
				<li>Flight crew who will get the Starship Pinafore to the requested locations.</li>
			</ul><br />
			<b>Frontend Users</b><br />
			Users will visit the website to reserve rooms, location, food, and other amenities.  We expect users from all known parts of the universe as well as some from parts that are, as yet, unvisited.  We must keep things simple but expect to deal with clients on an individual basis when necessary.
			<p>We know from over 400,000 star-years of past events that we must be prepared to host:
			<ul>
			<li>Relatively small, intimate receptions like weddings</li>
			<li>Private parties with the latest in five-dimensional Holodeck technology</li>
			<li>Large gatherings of varied species for peaceful talks or raucous brawls</li>			
			</ul>
			</p>
			We will start this web reservation system with just three rooms, three possible destinations, and a good selection of food and drink.  Since distances are large and timing is difficult, reservation will be for whole star-days.  Details for events will be arranged personally when the reservation date nears.</li>
